SliceAdmiral can be best described as an info-center for maximizing Rogue damage. It contains a bunch of timer bars, stat displays, and audio notifications that add up to nearly everything you need to know to properly time your Rogue's DPS cycle. It has a compact and configurable UI that features...

* Timer Bars for Slice and Dice, Rupture, Recuperate, Vendetta, Deadly Poison, Envenom, Garrotte and many, many more!
* Timer Bar sorting based on refresh priority
* Audio Reminders for refreshing and expiring abilities
* Stat displays for Attack Power, Crit %, and Attack Speed
* Rupture and Deadly Poison DoT damage and crit indicators
* Combo Point Bar
* Energy Bar

Little to no setup needed. Just load the mod and you're ready to rock! Good for Rogues of any spec.
