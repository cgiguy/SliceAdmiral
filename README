SliceAdmiral can best described as an info-center for maximizing Rogue damage. It contains a bunch of timer bars, stat displays, and audio notifications that add up to nearly everything you need to know to properly time your Rogue's DPS cycle. It has a compact and configurable UI that features...
 
* Timer Bars for Slice and Dice, Rupture, Recuperate, Vendetta, Deadly Poison, and Envenom buff
* Timer Bar sorting based on refresh priority
* Audio Reminders for refreshing and expiring abilities (SnD, Rupture, Recuperate and Vendetta)
* Stat displays for Attack Power, Crit %, and Attack Speed
* Rupture and Deadly Poison DoT damage and crit indicators
* Combo Point bar
* Energy bar
* New Options Menu interface, rebuilt from the ground up

Little to no setup needed. Just load the mod and you're ready to rock! Good for Rogues of any spec.

SliceAdmiral is a continuation of SliceCommander. Big thanks to the original authors for starting up this much-needed Rogue DPS project! 

The original author of SliceAdmiral, Linguine, is no longer working on this project.  I want to thank him for his time and effort on this much needed Rogue addon!
